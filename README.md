## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

# Rules

## Technology

- We'll use SSR for the pages that need to fetch data from database
- We'll use SSG for the pages that can be static like frequently question, blog post and data about the business
- Axios to fetch data
- If we can we should use lazy loading to show the images

## Styles

- CSS Modules
- SASS
- Mobile First
- BEM methodology
